Backbeat Networks creates network technology and products for mobile and social games. The company formed in early 2010 with a quartet of highly experienced systems engineers from console game development.

Their foundation technology is Jazz, a massively scalable client-server architecture for persistent game management and social platform integration. The system supports games that are interconnected across environments. Jazz is designed and built from the ground up for the emerging and future needs of the game market.

Consumer products include the exceptionally praised Triple Town for Kindle, bespoke game development, and several games which will soon reach market. Backbeat's future products emphasize multiplayer networking, mixed platforms, and great player experiences.
